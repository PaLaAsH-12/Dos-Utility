# Dos-Utility

#TCP/UDP-Dos

A Powerful Dos Utility tool.

This tool provides a knowledge about What is a Dos attack and lets you practically perform a Dos attack.

This can help you to carry out TCP and UDP Dos attacks and to check wether it is working or not,

type netstat -s before attack and netstat -s after the attack and compare the Ipv4 statics for TCP/UDP.

I will not say to use this for educational purpose cuz i have made this to pwn services.

Enjoy! :)
